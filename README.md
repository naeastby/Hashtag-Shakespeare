# Hashtag-Shakespeare
All things Shakespeare on Twitter! <br />
<br />
William Shakespeare may have died over 400 years ago, but his works have continued to influence our culture. Just look at Twitter -- people tweet quotes and use Shakespearean phrases all the time, and sometimes they don't even know they are doing it! <br />
<br />
Hashtag Shakespeare allows us to look at how people are using Shakespeare in the Twitterverse.
</br>
HashtagShakespeare_NoKeys contains the program to datamine Twitter with your own search terms. You must have your own Twitter Developer account in order to do this.
</br>
Check out our CSV data file (HashtagShakespeare_MasterFile.txt), our clean data Excel file (HashtagShakespeare_CleanData.xlsx), and our text files containing suggested search phrases or hashtags you can use to test out the program.
